The DRT is a web application that allows you to review Open Contracting data, validate it against the Open Contracting Data Standard, and review it for errors or places for improvement. You can also use it to covert data between JSON and Excel spreadsheet formats.

It runs at `standard.open-contracting.org/review/ <https://standard.open-contracting.org/review/>`_.
