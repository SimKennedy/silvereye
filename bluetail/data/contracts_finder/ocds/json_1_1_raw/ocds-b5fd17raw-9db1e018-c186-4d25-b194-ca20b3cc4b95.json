The provider(s) is/are required to directly impact learners in order for the University to ensure it can report to the OfS on engagement with learners through this programme. The University of Derby wishes to procure these Resilience Workshops, Oracy Skills Workshops and Motivational Speaker Services to ensure high quality for our students, particularly in terms of student experience, as measured through the NSS (National Student Survey) and graduate outcomes, as defined by LEO (longitudinal education outcomes). This will also support the successful achievement of aims and ambitions set out in its Strategic Framework. The University of Derby is publishing these opportunities as separate Lots. Bidders are welcome to bid for one or all of the Lots but each Lot will be evaluated separately and awarded based on MEAT (Most Economically Advantageous Tender) criteria for each using pricing and quality evaluation as outlined in the instructions in this document.
