Many of the finishes to roofs, gutters, cupola and spire date from 1957 and are therefore towards the end of their service life, evidenced by the water ingress that has been an increasing problem in recent years. The surviving Wren masonry suffers from heavy carbon staining and discolouration along with a pattern of defects known as ""corrosion jacking"", caused by concealed iron cramps rusting, expanding and subsequently splitting and cracking the stonework. The project seeks to return the Church to a sound state of repair and improve the presentation of the historic building within the prominent backdrop of Guildhall.
