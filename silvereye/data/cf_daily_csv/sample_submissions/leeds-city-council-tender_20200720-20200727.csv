Leeds City Centre Box Office (CCBO) is the ticketing department for Leeds City Council. It services Leeds Town Hall, Carriageworks Theatre, Millennium Square, Leeds International Concert Season, Leeds International Film Festivals (plus Young and INDI festivals) and Leeds International Beer Festival. It generates in excess of £3m of ticketing revenue per annum and delivers 250,000 ticket sales over 2300+ event instances each year. 

The box office also has ambitions to support Leeds City Councils wider cultural offering, including Breeze, Child Friendly Leeds and Leeds Museums & Galleries to support a unified approach to cultural delivery in Leeds. 

The Council is looking to procure a cloud based ticketing and CRM system which enables this approach to a singular cultural database of event attendees, membership holders and philanthropists to enable the Council to analyse data, create operational, marketing and programming strategies to deliver the best cultural experience possible. Leeds City Council has the ambition to be a digital, cultural and child friendly city and the solution procured must support these aims.

The solution needs to support multiple venues, requirements and avenue into the booking and CRM process through multiple website integrations. The council requires a partner to deliver its ambitious aims that is willing to be an integral part of the journey and an advocate for that cultural drive.",500000.0,GBP,2020-07-23T15:42:53Z,2020-08-26T00:00:00Z,CPV,48000000,Software package and information systems,Leeds City Council,,,Leeds
