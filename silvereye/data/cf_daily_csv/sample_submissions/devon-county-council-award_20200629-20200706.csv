Furthermore, a new signalised junction will be created with a new side road to the south of the A379 which will provide access to the proposed development area. The elements of work included in this phase of the scheme are, but not limited to: • Site Clearance • Earthworks • Drainage Works • Introduction of a staggered toucan crossing. • Modification and widening, where possible, of the existing shared use paths. • Realignment of the carriageway. • Resurfacing of the carriageway. • Road markings and signage. • Introduction of a new signalised junction. • Introduction of a new side road with shared paths and a staggered toucan crossing. • Removal of a layby. • Vehicle Restraint System Barriers • Street lighting electrical works. • Landscaping works.
