Back in 2019, we would regularly see around 900 remote concurrent connections from staff machines. During the lockdown, this has increased by 400%. We have increased our existing capacity as far as we can and have made significant
changes to the DCC laptops and used throttling of traffic to try and maintain the service for our customers. Ideally, we need to revert some of the changes, so we have a better understanding of what sites are being accessed and the removal of throttling will give everyone working from home an even better work experience. To achieve this, the next logical step is to increase the capacity
