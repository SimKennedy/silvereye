This SATTS device is the latest and most up to date version of the Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD) incorporating a multitude of new capabilities, compared with the first generation TSD currently surveying the SRN, that should ultimately enable comprehensive and detailed structural assessment of pavements at traffic speed.
Highways England took delivery of this SATTS device in January this year and following adaptation for UK use and acceptance trials will be available to undertake research surveys for this project from July 2020.  
The main aim of this two-year technical consultancy task is to develop a methodology that will enable the measurements from a device employing SATTS technology to be robustly converted into equivalent Deflectograph values that can be used to predict residual life and maintenance need.  Further research will be needed to fully utilise all the capabilities of the new technology incorporated within the SATTS device.",,,,,459894.0,GBP
