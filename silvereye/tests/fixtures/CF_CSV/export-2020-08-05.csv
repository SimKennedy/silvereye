The total available grant funding for the 2020/21 financial year will be £600,000.

Bidders for the funding must be able to demonstrate how they will spend their entire potential award by the end of the 2020/21 financial year. To ensure that there is as full as a geographic spread as possible we would welcome bids from partnerships or consortia.

The purpose of the funding is to provide support to a vitally important sector doing excellent work with refugee women. The Home Office is providing the grant funding to deliver support to refugee women, across the UK, to meet needs associated with the Covid-19 restrictions and the Covid-19 recovery. We expect the focus of support to be largely on addressing digital poverty but will consider suggestions for other support where bidders are able to demonstrate that these are high priority. 

Grants will be awarded to non-statutory sector organisations working nationally to provide services that help and support refugee women during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

While there is no cap on the amount of funding an organisation can bid for, up to the maximum of the funding of £600,000, we may award to one or more organisations. Therefore, all bids will need to be scalable: to ensure diversity of funding, please be aware that we may have to scale back top scoring bids.",active,1,"See description of related tender.",CPV,98000000,"Other community, social and personal services",http://cpv.data.ac.uk/code-98000000.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,GBP,600000,GBP,,"Other - Grants Competition",,,,,"Please apply directly to the buyer using the contact details provided, or follow the instructions given in the notice description or information section.",2020-08-05T08:44:49Z,2020-09-01T13:00:00Z,,,1,"Contract start","Anticipated contract start date",2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,,2,"Contract end","Anticipated contract end date",2021-03-31T00:00:00Z,,,1,NotApplicable,,GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/s4Rw35Tf,https://supplierregistration.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/notices/buyers.csv,,"HOME OFFICE","Peel Building, Marsham Street ",LONDON,,SW1P4DF,England,,RASIcommercialgrantsteam@homeoffice.gov.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
